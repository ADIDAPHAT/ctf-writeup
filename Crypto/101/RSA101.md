Select p: p is a prime (large)
p = 3

Select q: q is a prime (large)
q = 11

Compute n: n = p X q
n = 3 X 11

Check z: z = (p-1) X (q-1) # This is the totient(n). There are 20 relative primes to 33 (1,2,4,5,7,8,10,13,14,16,17,19,20.23,25,26,28,29,31,32)

Select d: gcd(totein(n),d) = 1; 1 < d < totient(n). 
d = 7 (7 and 20 have no common factors but 1)

Compute e: e = pow(d, -1) mod totient(n)
e = (1/7) mod 20.
e = 3. (round up)

Public key: KU = {e, n}
Private key: KR = {d, n}

Public key: KU = {3, 33}
Private key: KR = {7, 33}

for messege m = 5.
To encrypt: C = pow(M, e) mod n
C = pow(5, 3) mod 33
C = 26
To decrypt: M = pow(C, d) mod n
M = pow(26, 7) mod 33
M = 5
